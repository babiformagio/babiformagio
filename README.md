## Hi there 👋  I'm Babi Formagio! 👩🏻

As a daughter of a graphic designer/ advertiser, I was raised in the creative universe seeing my father over drawing boards, building layouts, letterings by hand and using a lot of vintage tools and processes that the younger generation didn't get to know. I took advantage of this opportunity and at a very young age started working as a fun activity alongside my father and from that point my path was set.

Graduated in graphic design since 2005, with over 17 years of experience, I'm an entrepreneur and a multidisciplinary professional. I'm a former business owner of a design company in Brazil called Cuca Design. It was a grateful experience in my professional life running a company. I was responsible for projects and creative team. I led the team to run the projects with the clients and I handled the day-to-day problems that in a company is usual.

**I just joined GitHub in November 2022 and I'm very excited to be part of the GitHub family and to be able to contribute to our team!** 🤩 :octocat:

I'm Brazilian, originally from the city of Rio de Janeiro "the wonderful city" and a real beach lover, I'm currently based in the city of São Paulo and have learned to enjoy a stroll in the park on weekends. 🇧🇷

I'm the mother of a very cute baby boy and married to a digital product professional (he's my mentor and biggest inspiration). 👨‍👩‍👦💛

I'm better known as Babi. I'm very organized and sociable. I'm an amateur runner, I love traveling and working out, but I’m also a foody person. 

**Nice to meet you!** ☺️
